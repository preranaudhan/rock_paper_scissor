# rock_paper_scissor
This project is a modern twist on the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, enhanced with a graphical user interface (GUI) and machine learning capabilities. The game is built using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and incorporates a Random Forest Classifier to predict the computer's next move based on the player's previous moves.
